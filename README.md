# Scale Explorer

ScaleExplorer is a simulation framework that enables agile exploration over the large machine learning model design and optimization space. This new capability will unlock efficiency and sustainability optimization opportunities to flexibly adapt to the constantly-changing training environment. As part of a broader open-source effort to enable the next generation of AI systems, we will be continuously updating this repository with new research tools and features.

## MADMax
